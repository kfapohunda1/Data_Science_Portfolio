### [ Project 1: Covert Speech to Text Using Watson Speech Translator](https://github.com/kfapohunda1/Python_Course/blob/02e02349725b95c4e28d28e2bf998b93457b3c84/Speech%20to%20Text%20Translator.ipynb)

   * Converted an audio file of an English speaker to text using Watson speech to text API
   * Translated the English version to a Spanish version using a Watson language translator API
   * Used python functions to create parameters for managing the wav and tex files

### [ Project 2: Using Python to Extract, Manipulate and Visualize Stock Data (Gamestop vs Tesla)](https://github.com/kfapohunda1/Python_Course/blob/2135b7428390e3b950f75e304a9dc354097b2e5a/Jupyter%20Notebook%20(9).ipynb)

   * Used  ticker functions in python library to directly extract stock data from ticker reports
   * Scraped several webpages for stocks and share prices not available via stock API using beautiful soup 
   * Cleaned, manipulated and structured raw stock data in python dataframe for analysis 
   * Developed GameStop and Tesla's stock dashboard using the matplotlib library
