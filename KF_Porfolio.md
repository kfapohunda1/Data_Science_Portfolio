### [ Project 1: Covert Speech to Text Using Watson Speech Translator](https://github.com/kfapohunda1/Python_Course/blob/02e02349725b95c4e28d28e2bf998b93457b3c84/Speech%20to%20Text%20Translator.ipynb)

   * Converted an audio file of an English speaker to text using Watson speech to text API
   * Translated the English version to a Spanish version using a Watson language translator API
   * Used python functions to create parameters for managing the wav and tex files

### [ Project 2: Using Python to Extract, Manipulate and Visualize Stock Data (Gamestop vs Tesla)](https://github.com/kfapohunda1/Python_Course/blob/2135b7428390e3b950f75e304a9dc354097b2e5a/Jupyter%20Notebook%20(9).ipynb)

   * Used the ticker functions in python library to directly extract stock data available in ticker reports
   * Scraped several webpages for stocks and share prices not available via stock API using beautiful soup 
   * Loaded and manipulated stock data in python dataframe for easy vizualization
   * Displayed GameStop and Tesla's stock in a graph using the plotly library


### [ Project 3: Predicting Housing Sale Price in King County, USA ](https://github.com/kfapohunda1/Python_Course/blob/6de88edb90bf3b05613ef8a434a5587e38be6263/Predicting%20House%20Sales%20in%20King%20County,%20USA%20.ipynb)

   * Scraped for dataset and performed data wrangling for easy analysis
   * Performed exploratory data analysis with descriptive and visual statistics for better understanding of data
   * Developed model pipelines to analyze, transform and predict housing prices using data on house features and attributes
   * Evaluated and refined models using ridge regression and R^2 values.
